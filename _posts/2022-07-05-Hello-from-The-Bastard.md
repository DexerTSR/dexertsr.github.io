Hi there

You can call me Dexer, its an alias that some know me as.

Who am I? I’m many things but mostly a techie. I’m usually creating bots for discord, coding or learning new skills or prospectives that range from music production to philosophy. My background you can say its one very few have experienced, especially within cybersecurity to a degree.

Many kids under the generation that I came up with, grew up with learning computers at a young age. It was the government’s agenda to have every kid grow up and keep up with the emerging tech to survive in the new millennium. I still remember the 1st computer I ever used which was Windows 98. Not as big or recognized as Windows 95, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, BBS or Apple II as the old heads like to reminisce about. But hey, as a kid of the era who grew up with not much and in public school. It was what the school I went at the time had then.

The irony of that is the government themselves couldn’t capitalize properly on the generation that was in those classrooms. Those that became good and decided to go rogue were chased. However on the few that the government was able to capitalize on; unfortunately their own greed produced the circumstances that created a situation like Snowden faced. Rarely, very few stayed in the shadows, did work and when it was time to leave it behind, it was to be.

In my case, I was one of the few which stayed in the shadows and walked away. And, for a moment, I thought that was it.

However in recent years after spending years away. I came out of the shadows and was writing a blog with members of my old group that I formed years ago. Other than the usual tech reviews and tips. We were also explaining why and how certain events tied up to technology from our view.

This was taken upon originally because I saw that many people outside of the tech world have virtually little to no clue of how technology have an impact in their lives. Even if they did by a stretch, its not enough because the well of knowing is never-ending. Then again, that can be true for anybody really.

However, circumstances intervened that changed things up a bit in my life plus given the pandemic. It took a toll.

However, I did feel like I missed writing about things, explaining and expanding that simply a 280 character limit on twitter. Even though it used to be 140. But shit, I like to write a lot, Lulz.

Not sure where this will go. Not sure if people will actually read this shit. The only thing I know is I like to write things and has become a passion of mine in recent years. So I’ll take this as much as I’m able to.

After all, time will tell where all this leads to

till next time.
